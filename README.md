# Continuous Thought Machines Conceptualization

**A project inspired by the "Continuous Thought Machines" (CTM) paper.**  
This repo visualizes the behaviour of biologically-inspired neurons that process inputs over time and synchronize with one another — capturing key ideas like memory, weighted history, and phase alignment.

---

## Project Goals

- ✅ Simulate a CTM-style neuron with memory and temporal processing
- ✅ Visualize how neurons activate based on historical input and sync state
- ✅ Explore concepts like adaptive compute and latent neural synchronization
- ✅ Learn and demonstrate modern directions in biologically-inspired machine learning

---

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the [Continuous Thought Machines (CTM)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.05522) paper by Darlow et al., which explores timing and synchronization as foundational elements of neural computation.
